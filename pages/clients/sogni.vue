              Sogni has made waves with its AI-powered art creation tool,
              <b>Sogni Studio.</b> Its mission is to empower artists using
              next-generation tools driven by open-source AI models. Launched in
              early 2024, Sogni offers its platform at a lower cost, with faster
              performance and fewer restrictions for its users. But how can
              Sogni create a <b>best-in-class</b> product using cutting-edge

              expenses of running AI models on high-end GPUs?
            </p>
            <p>
              Enter Nosana. In their search for the ideal GPU provider to scale
              their product affordably, Sogni found Nosana. By leveraging

              Disrupting Creative Tools with Innovation
            </h4>
            <p class="mb-5">
              For decades, Adobe has dominated the digital creativity landscape.
              While competitors have offered alternatives, none have effectively
              challenged Adobe’s dominance. This raises a crucial question: How
              can a new company develop innovative products that redefine
              digital artistry and go beyond what existing tools provide?
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
              The rise of generative AI technologies, such as Stable Diffusion,
              opened doors to new opportunities. These advancements enabled
              Sogni to craft tools that allow artists to express their
              creativity more efficiently, precisely, and boldly.
            </p>
            <p>
              Sogni.AI delivers AI-powered art generation tools for artists,
              catering to both professionals and hobbyists. Instead of relying
              solely on simple web-based tools, Sogni offers a dedicated iOS and
              macOS application with robust workflows akin to Adobe’s
              software—minus the steep subscription fees or restrictive usage
              limits. With over 100 specialized open-source AI models, artists
              can create pixel-perfect designs tailored to their visions.

              The Power of Nosana’s Decentralized GPUs
            </h4>
            <p class="mb-5">
              Initially, Sogni relied on users’ local devices for processing,
              including Apple’s M1, M2, and M3 chips. While capable, these
              devices struggled with the computational demands of
              <b>Stable Diffusion models</b>, leading to delays that disrupted
              the creative flow. Sogni needed a
              <b>scalable, cost-effective, and reliable solution.</b>
            </p>

            <p class="mb-5">
              Nosana provided the perfect answer. Its
              <b>decentralized GPU network</b> taps into global consumer
              hardware, enabling flexible and affordable GPU sourcing. By
              integrating Nosana, Sogni offloaded intensive computational tasks
              to remote GPUs, delivering
              <b>faster, smoother art generation</b> without sacrificing quality
              or affordability.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-5">
              To ensure low inference times and a seamless user experience,
              Nosana recommended the <b>NVIDIA RTX 4090</b> for Sogni. This GPU
              strikes the perfect balance between cost and performance, with
              specifications such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="ml-5 mb-5">
              <li><b>CUDA Cores:</b> 16,384</li>
              <li><b>Boost Clock:</b> 2.52 GHz</li>
              <li><b>Memory:</b> 24 GB GDDR6X</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              For larger-scale applications, Nosana also offers GPUs like the
              NVIDIA H100 or NVIDIA A100, which are ideal for training AI
              models.
