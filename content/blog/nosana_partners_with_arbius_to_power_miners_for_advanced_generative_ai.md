__We're excited to announce a partnership with Arbius! Nosana's GPU network will fuel Arbius miners, empowering them to tackle complex generative AI tasks.__

Phase 2 of [Nosana's](https://nosana.io/) test grid focuses on expanding the variety of AI jobs the platform can handle. This means ensuring the test grid can accommodate a wider range of AI workloads and use cases. To achieve this goal, we're partnering with industry leaders like Arbius to put new functionalities through their paces. By collaborating with valued partners, we can effectively test and refine the Nosana platform, shaping its future capabilities.

### Nosana x Arbius integration
[Arbius](https://arbius.ai/) is experiencing a surge in demand from large clients and requires significant access to powerful GPUs. Nosana's extensive network of GPU providers is ideally suited for this need and Nosana's test grid provides the perfect platform to test and validate their infrastructure requirements.

### What the Main Focus Will Be
During the second phase of the test grid, Arbius will be deploying state of the art open-source AI models such as Metaâ€™s Llama 3 400b. This collaborative effort not only benefits Arbius, but also contributes to the advancement of open-source AI tools, and fosters a spirit of community within the developer ecosystem, creating a shared AI economy for all.

While Nosana provides the perfect platform to access H100/Blackwell GPUs for Arbius users, the actual mining process itself happens on the Arbius network. Arbius has a detailed guide available that explains how to mine on their platform.

### A Shared Vision: Democratizing AI Together
Both Nosana and Arbius share a core belief: AI should be accessible to everyone. By combining Arbius' decentralized network with Nosana's extensive GPU marketplace, we are creating a powerful ecosystem that empowers users and dismantles the entry barriers in the AI world. Arbius' user-controlled design prevents monopolies, and their permissionless access approach allows anyone to interact with AI models freely. Similarly, Nosana's decentralized approach gives users direct access to GPU nodes that scale with their computational needs as required, all while ensuring high levels of security to protect sensitive data and intellectual property.
