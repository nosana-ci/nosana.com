The evolving landscape of cryptocurrency often calls for shifts, agility, and strategic vision. Keeping these values at the forefront, we're introducing modifications to our staking annual percentage yield (APY). These adjustments are in line with Nosana’s dedication to enduring growth, empowering our users, and securing long-term stability.

Staking remains a cornerstone of our ecosystem, underpinning the Nosana Network’s security. Our committed holders are rewarded for bolstering this security. When we debuted our native staking pool in August 2022, we anticipated the need for periodic assessments. On our second anniversary, we've reached such a milestone. 

At this juncture, we’ve identified the necessity of recalibrating our staking APY. This recalibration is pivotal for preserving equilibrium, mitigating the impact on pricing as our token value increases, and aligning with our peer group, which has notably lower APY levels.

### The Modifications:

Starting January 14th, we will modify the staking emissions rate, leading to an approximate 30 percent reduction in APY. Our dynamic staking rewards system, which factors in multiple variables, might result in a slightly greater or lesser APY fluctuation.

This adjustment is part of a two-step process; the details of the second phase will be defined in due course. 


### The Significance of These Changes

*  **For Sustainable Growth:** Our revised staking rewards are tailored to promote robust growth, aiming for a flourishing ecosystem now and in the future.
* **For Balance:** Our commitment to appreciating our long-term network supporters continues. We aim to sustain the purchasing power of our token and align our reward structure with that of our peers.

With these changes, we aim to strike a balance between rewarding our long-term supporters and ensuring the overall health and stability of the Nosana ecosystem. We believe these adjustments are necessary for the continued success and sustainability of our network.
Your trust and support are invaluable to us as we navigate these changes together. We remain steadfast in our mission to deliver a secure, stable, and prosperous Nosana Network for all our stakeholders.
