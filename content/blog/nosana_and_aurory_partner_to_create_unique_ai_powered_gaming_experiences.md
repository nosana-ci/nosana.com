The world of gaming is changing rapidly, driven by advancements in blockchain technology and artificial intelligence (AI). Leading this exciting change is Aurory, a Web3 gaming studio known for its free-to-play games. Nosana is excited to announce a new partnership with Aurory to use the power of AI to create even better gaming experiences. Nosana will use its decentralized compute network to integrate AI into Aurory's games, offering players something truly special.

### Nosana and Aurory Team Up

Aurory is working on new ways to enhance the gaming experience by integrating AI capabilities into their games, starting with their flagship title, Seekers of Tokane. The game, set in the captivating universe of Aurory, combines exploration, battles, player interactions, and strategy. Aurory aims to enhance the player experience by introducing AI-powered non-player characters (NPCs) that can engage with players, providing lore and backstory about the game world.

To make this happen, Aurory has partnered with Nosana, which specializes in decentralized computing. Built on the Solana blockchain, Nosana's network of GPU nodes offers a cost-effective way to run AI models. This lets Aurory use advanced AI, like chatbots, without needing expensive infrastructure.

### How Nosana and Aurory Work Together

Nosana will provide Aurory with the tools they need to run AI models smoothly as well as  the necessary endpoints and support to run AI models, starting with chatbots for NPC interactions in the game's villages. This approach allows Aurory to focus on the creative aspects of AI integration while relying on Nosana's expertise in decentralized computing.

Nosana's decentralized network ensures high availability, low latency, and scalability. These are important factors for delivering a smooth and responsive AI experience within the game to its players. As Aurory continues to explore and push the boundaries of AI in gaming, Nosana's infrastructure will be ready to support their growing needs.

### Looking Ahead

The partnership between Nosana and Aurory goes beyond the initial integration of chatbots.  Both teams are excited to work closely together, share ideas, and explore new ways to use AI in gaming. Nosana's team will help Aurory find the best AI models and setups to ensure the best performance and player experience.

Nosana and Aurory are reshaping the future of gaming. By integrating cutting-edge AI, theyâ€™re creating immersive experiences that blur the line between real and virtual worlds, putting players at the heart of a constantly evolving adventure.
