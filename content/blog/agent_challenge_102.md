The Nosana Builder Challenge is back! After the success of Agents 101, we're excited to announce **Agents 102** — a developer challenge where you'll build intelligent AI agents with frontend interfaces and deploy them on the Nosana decentralized compute network.

## Quick Details

- **Prize Pool**: $3,000 USDC for top 10 submissions
- **Start Date**: October 10, 2025
- **Submission Deadline**: October 24, 2025

## Your Mission

Build an intelligent AI agent that performs real-world tasks using:

- **Mastra framework** for agent orchestration
- **Tool calling** to interact with external services
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for enhanced capabilities
- **Custom frontend** to showcase your agent's functionality

Then deploy your complete stack (agent + frontend + LLM) on Nosana's decentralized network!

## Agent Ideas to Inspire You

The possibilities are endless! Here are some ideas:

- 🤖 **Personal Assistant** - Schedule management, email drafting, task automation
- 📊 **Data Analyst Agent** - Fetch financial data, generate insights, create visualizations
- 🌐 **Web Researcher** - Aggregate information from multiple sources, summarize findings
- 🛠️ **DevOps Helper** - Monitor services, automate deployments, manage infrastructure
- 🎨 **Content Creator** - Generate social media posts, blog outlines, marketing copy
- 🔍 **Smart Search** - Multi-source search with AI-powered result synthesis
- 💬 **Customer Support Bot** - Answer FAQs, ticket routing, knowledge base queries

**Be Creative!** The best agents solve real problems in innovative ways.

## The Framework: Mastra

We're using [Mastra](https://mastra.ai), the powerful TypeScript framework that makes building AI applications intuitive and fast. Mastra provides all the primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations, and evaluations.
