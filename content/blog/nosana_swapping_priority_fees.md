At Nosana, we’re always looking for ways to make our platform more accessible, more reliable, and easier to use for everyone. In today’s update, we’re thrilled to introduce two major improvements designed to lower barriers to entry and reduce transaction failures: **in-Dashboard token swapping** and **dynamic priority fees**.

## Lowering Barriers

Nosana jobs are paid with NOS, the lifeblood of our network. Clients use NOS to pay GPU hosts for each job they post. Until now, clients had to purchase NOS from an exchange or manually swap tokens in their wallets. That extra step introduced friction and sometimes confusion—especially for new users.

**Enter our brand-new, in-Dashboard token swapping feature.** You can now easily swap SOL, USDC, or USDT for NOS right inside the Nosana Dashboard. No extra steps, no leaving the UI. Just a seamless experience from start to finish.

### How It Works

1. **Go to the template page** on the Dashboard.
2. **Select a template** to set up your AI or compute job.
3. **Connect your wallet** to the platform.
4. **Swap** SOL, USDC, or USDT for NOS right there.
5. **Pay for your jobs**—you’re all set!

We’ve integrated Jupiter’s swap functionality under the hood, so you always get the best conversion rate for your tokens at the moment of purchase. Simple, secure, and designed to keep you moving forward.

## Improving Reliability

One of our ongoing goals is to ensure every transaction on Nosana is as reliable as possible. We know how frustrating it can be when a transaction fails—seeing the dreaded “Solana is congested” error can really slow you down.

### Why Does This Happen?

Each Nosana transaction is powered by the Solana blockchain. When you buy NOS or post a job, your transaction goes to a validator. If the network is very busy (for example, during a big NFT mint or a major airdrop), validators can get overloaded. At those times, transactions without additional incentives can get dropped.

### Introducing Dynamic Priority Fees

Solana offers a way to include a “priority fee,” which essentially tips the validator to process your transaction faster. To help your transactions sail through even during peak congestion, we’ve added dynamic priority fees to every transaction on Nosana.

- **Dynamic Calculation:** The priority fee automatically adjusts based on network demand, reducing the chances of transaction failures.
- **Better Experience:** Fewer dropped transactions mean less anxiety and a more streamlined workflow for our clients, hosts, and community.
