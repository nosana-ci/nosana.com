## **Introduction**

Rivalz, built on Ethereum, is revolutionizing the way dApps function. By enhancing dApps with AI capabilities, these applications gain new, powerful features that elevate blockchain-based innovation.

Combining blockchain-powered dApps with AI features will drive a new wave of advancements in the space, making applications smarter, more efficient, and capable of handling real-world data and computations.

## **AI-Powered dApps**

Within a blockchain environment, compute costs are high, which is why only the most essential calculations are performed on-chain. This ensures affordability and speed but limits the ability to run resource-intensive AI models.

### **So how can AI be integrated into dApps efficiently?**

This is where Nosana comes in. Nosana’s decentralized GPU compute network allows Rivalz to run AI models in a **trustless, decentralized manner**, without relying on centralized servers. Even better, because of Nosana’s architecture, compute jobs can be posted directly to Nosana via smart contracts—eliminating the need for intermediaries.

## **AI Features in dApps**

Decentralized applications enable users to interact with services and each other without intermediaries. They provide access to transparent, trustless systems while ensuring ownership and control over data, digital assets, and identities.

However, dApps have historically been limited in their functionality—until now. With Rivalz integrating AI oracle systems into dApps, entirely new feature sets become available:
- dApps can now pull in data from trusted sources.
- AI oracles running on Nosana can analyze or predict outcomes.
- Smart contracts can trigger actions based on AI-driven insights.

## **Rivalz Use Cases**

With Rivalz, a dApp can fetch **market data and social media trends** to optimize trading strategies. DeFi applications can integrate built-in trading bots, automate yield farming, and maintain transparency while resisting manipulation.

### **AI Use Cases in Blockchain**
- **DeFi:** AI-powered smart contracts can assess credit risk, detect fraudulent transactions, optimize yield farming, and improve trading strategies.
- **NFTs:** NFT marketplaces can offload the creation of generative art directly from a smart contract. With a single transaction, an AI model can generate unique NFTs.
- **Supply Chain Management:** Blockchain-based supply chain systems can leverage AI-driven logistics to anticipate demand fluctuations and optimize resource allocation.
- **Smart Contract Security:** AI-driven security mechanisms can scan and respond to potential threats before a contract is deployed.

Rivalz is bridging the power of AI and smart contracts, significantly **expanding the capabilities of dApps**.

## **Why Rivalz and Nosana Are Teaming Up**

Running AI workloads on-chain is computationally intensive and expensive—making it unfeasible for blockchains. This is Nosana’s **core strength**.

Each request is processed through the **AI Oracle system**, where Nosana receives payment in **$NOS** for every AI inference. Simultaneously, a portion of transaction fees is allocated in **Rivalz’s native token, $RIZ**, fostering a sustainable ecosystem that incentivizes both AI resource providers and developers.

### **Key Benefits for Rivalz:**
1. **Lower operational costs** – Workloads are shifted to Nosana’s decentralized GPUs, reducing expenses.
2. **Scalability** – Access a global GPU pool that grows with user demand.
3. **Better user experience** – Affordable compute power enables faster, more accessible AI-driven solutions.
4. **Smart contract-native AI compute** – Nosana enables smart contracts to **pay directly for their own compute**, eliminating the need for third-party payment mechanisms.

## **Looking Ahead**

This partnership **unlocks the next wave of AI-driven dApps**, making advanced AI models more accessible on-chain. dApps will now be **smarter, more efficient, and capable of real-time AI-powered decision-making**.

Developers and businesses can now harness the combined power of **Nosana’s decentralized infrastructure** and **Rivalz’s AI Oracles** to build **cutting-edge solutions** previously unattainable in the decentralized ecosystem.
