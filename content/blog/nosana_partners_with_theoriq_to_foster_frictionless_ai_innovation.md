We're excited to share our partnership with [Theoriq](https://www.theoriq.ai/), connecting their innovative AI solutions with our scalable compute resources. By leveraging Nosana’s infrastructure, Theoriq can decentralize AI resource allocation, pushing the boundaries of AI development with greater efficiency, flexibility, and affordability. 

Theoriq’s platform serves as a hub for AI agents utilizing techniques like long context windows (8k+), retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups, and various large language models (LLMs). These agents continuously experiment with different model setups to stay innovative, ensuring Theoriq remains at the forefront of AI development.
By leveraging Nosana’s infrastructure, Theoriq gains the scalable compute power needed to meet the diverse needs of their AI agents. This partnership allows Theoriq to push AI innovation forward without being limited by costly or scarce computing resources.

## Key Benefits of the Partnership

**Reducing Costs and Enhancing Efficiency for AI Developers.** Traditionally, accessing high-performance compute resources has been costly and limited. With Nosana, AI developers can train and deploy models faster and more efficiently, without heavy hardware investments. This collaboration ensures that compute resources are always readily available and affordable, allowing developers to focus on innovation rather than infrastructure.

**Demonstrating the Potential of Decentralized AI Solutions.** Nosana’s scalable compute resources allow Theoriq to offer a decentralized approach to AI development, moving away from traditional constraints. This fosters a community-driven governance model where AI innovation is limitless and built on social evolution and blockchain principles. Theoriq thrives on composability and community-driven governance, creating a robust environment for continuous AI advancement.

## How Nosana’s Compute Resources Power Theoriq’s AI Agents

Theoriq provides a web3-native way to access AI agents, offering AI agent developers and resource providers a chance to contribute and earn. Their solution involves running various LLM models to power their agents, using techniques like long context windows (8k+) and innovative retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) setups.

In Theoriq's architecture, compute is essential to power their agents. With this partnership, Theoriq gains access to scalable compute that matches the needs of their diverse AI agents. This synergy allows Theoriq to explore new frontiers in AI without the constraints of expensive or scarce computing power. Nosana’s infrastructure is flexible and scalable, enabling Theoriq to dynamically allocate resources to meet their innovative AI models' demands.

### Key Benefits of This Synergy
