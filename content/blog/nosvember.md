Throughout the month, we’ll host simple competitions and community-driven challenges 
designed to spotlight the creativity, collaboration, and momentum that shape Nosana. There will be **over $1,000 in $NOS rewards**, but the heart of Nosvember is participation, connection, and shared energy.

**Nosvember is open to everyone** — builders, creatives, content makers, newcomers, and 
long-time contributors. No experience is required. If you’re here, you’re part of it. The goal is to show up, share, and enjoy building together.

One of the early events in Nosvember will be the **Drawing Game**, a relaxed community activity hosted on Discord using [Sketchful.io](https://sketchful.io/). It’s open to everyone and designed to bring out creativity and laughter rather than competition. Participants will sketch, guess, and have fun together in voice chat. The top three players will receive **€50 in $NOS rewards.**

Later in the month comes the **Nosana Thread Challenge**, where community members can 
write threads about Nosana. The focus is on sharing perspectives and helping others learn 
more about the ecosystem. The top three threads will share **€150 in $NOS rewards.**

The **Nosana Quiz** will test how well the community knows Nosana and Web3 as a whole. It’s meant to be simple, engaging, and a good reason to learn something new. The top three 
participants will share **€50 in $NOS**.

The **Nosana Meme Contest** invites everyone to create and share memes, short videos, or any fun visual content about Nosana. It’s lighthearted and open-ended, giving space for humor and creativity. The best three entries will share **€100 in $NOS rewards.**

To wrap up the month, the **Big Poker Tournament** will bring the community together for one 
final game. It’s a friendly competition with the finalists sharing a €100 prize pool, marking the 
final event before the big **Nosana Rewards Ceremony** at the very end of Nosvember.

individuals who provide the biggest community growth.
