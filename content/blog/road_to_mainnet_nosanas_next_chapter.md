After months of hard work and improvements, weâ€™re thrilled to announce that the Nosana Test Grid is wrapping up, and the Nosana Mainnet is just around the corner! This milestone means the Test Grid has reached a production-ready state. Letâ€™s take a moment to reflect on what weâ€™ve accomplished and look ahead to whatâ€™s next.

### **Looking Back: A Year of Progress**

A year ago, we launched the Nosana Test Grid with the support of 3 million $NOS tokens, encouraging participation and contributions through a three-phase rollout:

- **Phase 1:** Onboarded the first NVIDIA GPUs to the platform, launched the Nosana Dashboard, and began processing workloads for Compute Clients.
- **Phase 2:** Over 1,000 GPU Providers joined as we expanded registration and implemented testing protocols. We also tackled Solana network congestion to improve scalability.
- **Phase 3:** Introduced staking for Hosts, tested pricing models for both Hosts and Compute Clients, and improved the Nosana CLI, SDK, and benchmarking suite for enhanced security and reliability.

Feedback from Hosts and Compute Compute played a crucial role in shaping Nosana into a robust platform for AI workloads.

### **Introducing Community and Premium Markets**

To create a fair and performance-driven environment for our two client groups, weâ€™re launching two tiers: **Community Markets** and **Premium Markets.**

### **Community Markets: The Starting Point for Hosts**

The Community Market is designed for new and unvalidated Hosts, offering them a place to start, test their setups, and prove reliability.

Key features:

- **Immediate Access:** Hosts are onboarded automatically, bypassing the old waitlist system.
- **Affordable Options for Compute Clients:** Compute Clients can access GPU resources at reduced rates, providing flexibility while Hosts prove their performance.
- **Proving Grounds:** Hosts complete jobs like benchmarking and anti-spoof checks to qualify for Premium Markets.
- **Performance-Based Rewards:** Hosts earn reduced rewards during this phase, incentivizing improvements and advancement.

### **Premium Markets: The Top Tier for High Performers**

The Premium Market is for validated, high-performing Hosts offering reliable resources for critical workloads.

Key features:

- **Guaranteed Reliability:** Hosts must meet strict performance criteria and pass anti-spoof checks to join.
- **Fair Compensation:** Hosts earn standard rewards and enjoy consistent job demand.
- **Optimized for Compute Clients:** Premium nodes handle the most complex workloads with efficiency and reliability.
- **Commitment Through Staking:** Hosts meet staking requirements, reinforcing their dedication to the network.

As a token of appreciation, all performant Test Grid Hosts will automatically move to the Premium Market upon Mainnet launch.

### **How It All Comes Together**

- **Around the Mainnet launch:** Waitlisted Hosts will transition into the Community Market.
- **Starting January 14th:** New Hosts will skip the waitlist and begin in the Community Market, ready to prove themselves.
- **Performance assessments:** GPU Hosts will be evaluated regularly, with opportunities for promotion to Premium Markets or removal for underperformance.

This system ensures a dynamic, competitive, and fair marketplace for both Hosts and Compute Clients.

### **Powering AI Inference with Nosana**

Nosana is designed to meet the growing demand for AI inference workloads, offering Hosts a way to monetize their resources while giving Compute Clients scalable and reliable GPU power.
