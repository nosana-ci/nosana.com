After months of hard work and improvements, weâ€™re thrilled to announce that the Nosana Test Grid is wrapping up, and the Nosana Mainnet is just around the corner! This milestone means the Test Grid has reached a production-ready state. Letâ€™s take a moment to reflect on what weâ€™ve accomplished and look ahead to whatâ€™s next.

### **Looking Back: A Year of Progress**

A year ago, we launched the Nosana Test Grid with the support of 3 million $NOS tokens, encouraging participation and contributions through a three-phase rollout:

- **Phase 1:** Onboarded the first NVIDIA GPUs to the platform, launched the Nosana Dashboard, and began processing workloads for Compute Renters.
- **Phase 2:** Over 1,000 GPU Providers joined as we expanded registration and implemented testing protocols. We also tackled Solana network congestion to improve scalability.
- **Phase 3:** Introduced staking for GPU Providers, tested pricing models for both GPU Providers and Compute Renters, and improved the Nosana CLI, SDK, and benchmarking suite for enhanced security and reliability.

Feedback from GPU Providers and Compute Renters played a crucial role in shaping Nosana into a robust platform for AI workloads.

### **Introducing Community and Premium Markets**

To create a fair and performance-driven environment for our two client groups, weâ€™re launching two tiers: **Community Markets** and **Premium Markets.**

### **Community Markets: The Starting Point for GPU Providers**

The Community Market is designed for new and unvalidated GPU Providers, offering them a place to start, test their setups, and prove reliability.

Key features:

- **Immediate Access:** GPU Providers are onboarded automatically, bypassing the old waitlist system.
- **Affordable Options for Compute Renters:** Compute Renters can access GPU resources at reduced rates, providing flexibility while GPU Providers prove their performance.
- **Proving Grounds:** GPU Providers complete jobs like benchmarking and anti-spoof checks to qualify for Premium Markets.
- **Performance-Based Rewards:** GPU Providers earn reduced rewards during this phase, incentivizing improvements and advancement.

### **Premium Markets: The Top Tier for High Performers**

The Premium Market is for validated, high-performing GPU Providers offering reliable resources for critical workloads.

Key features:

- **Guaranteed Reliability:** GPU Providers must meet strict performance criteria and pass anti-spoof checks to join.
- **Fair Compensation:** GPU Providers earn standard rewards and enjoy consistent job demand.
- **Optimized for Compute Renters:** Premium nodes handle the most complex workloads with efficiency and reliability.
- **Commitment Through Staking:** GPU Providers meet staking requirements, reinforcing their dedication to the network.

As a token of appreciation, all performant Test Grid GPU Providers will automatically move to the Premium Market upon Mainnet launch.

### **How It All Comes Together**

- **Around the Mainnet launch:** Waitlisted GPU Providers will transition into the Community Market.
- **Starting January 14th:** New GPU Providers will skip the waitlist and begin in the Community Market, ready to prove themselves.
- **Performance assessments:** GPU Providers will be evaluated regularly, with opportunities for promotion to Premium Markets or removal for underperformance.

This system ensures a dynamic, competitive, and fair marketplace for both GPU Providers and Compute Renters.
