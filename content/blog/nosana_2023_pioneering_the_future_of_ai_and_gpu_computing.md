Undoubtedly, 2023 has been a defining year for Nosana and its community. With the demand for AI inference showing no signs of slowing, our commitment in 2023 centered on scaling up new capacity and expanding our offerings. The project reached a significant milestone with the release of its test grid to the public, and the community experienced remarkable growth. Beyond the numbers, it was a year of innovation and adaptation, where Nosana not only met challenges head-on but also seized new opportunities. This transformative period culminated in its pivot to AI inference, marking a significant evolution in the company's trajectory.

Without further ado, let's dive into the key advancements made by the Nosana Network in 2023, highlighting its journey and achievements. 


### Pivot to AI Inference with Solana

In 2023, we boldly [pivoted to AI inference](https://nosana.io/blog/new-direction-ai-inference). With our transition away from CI/CD services, we spearheaded a massive GPU-compute grid for AI inference, a purposeful move to integrate blockchain technology into AI. Solana's features make it ideal for handling AI's demanding computational requirements.

We observed the need for scalable computational resources as a result of the rising demand for GPUs in AI, particularly with developments like OpenAI's ChatGPT. Our pivot to AI inference on Solana aims to make AI more accessible and to reduce reliance on centralized resources.

This transition isn't merely a business decision; it's a commitment to pushing the boundaries of AI and blockchain integration. It addresses immediate AI industry needs while laying the groundwork for future innovations, emphasizing our dedication to realizing AI's full potential.

### A Year Full of Workshops, Events, and Meetups

Throughout 2023, Nosana laid the foundation for a future where a decentralized community governs AI inference. Our team attended and spoke at several events, including EthCC Paris, Solana Hacker House, and most recently [Solana Breakpoint](https://nosana.io/blog/breakpoint-2023-bridging-the-global-gpu-shortage), to name a few. Beyond attending these larger conferences, we also organized and attended meetups, hackathons, and other gatherings, enabling us to connect with the Nosana community and gain a deeper understanding of their needs and aspirations. These interactions were undoubtedly a highlight of the year!

### Incentivized Public Test Grid

In December, Nosana launched the first phase of its [Incentivized Public Test Grid](https://nosana.sh/test-grid). This highly anticipated program demonstrates the potential power of Nosana’s GPU network. Over 100 GPUs were connected by developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts to establish the first grid. This selection consisted of over 20 different kinds of consumer devices, from RTX 3060 laptop cards to A6000s, reinforcing our focus on supporting a diversity of devices. The test grid has given the project valuable information on performance, update procedures, pricing, and growth and is paving the way for the coming year.

### Nosana Explorer

At the end of the year, Nosana released a new platform to share the progress of the test grid in real time - "The Nosana Explorer." This interface has provided a lot of insight into the network's performance during the test grid - including the inference jobs that have been run, their prices, and their duration. Take a look at the insights yourself at [https://explorer.nosana.io](https://explorer.nosana.io)


### Looking Ahead

This year has been Nosana’s most important one yet. The demand for AI-inference and GPU power has propelled our project forward, and we are excited to see a wealth of devices, ranging from laptops to workstations, powering AI Inference on the Nosana network in the coming months. 

We remain committed to making AI inference more accessible and efficient and to fostering a community where ideas and innovations are freely shared. Excited about the possibilities ahead, our goal is to see Nosana's technology used across industries, solving complex problems ethically and sustainably. 

Thank you for a fantastic 2023, and here's to an even brighter 2024.
