Over the course of a few weeks, we watched builders dive into our open-source repos, ask brilliant questions, create unique solutions, and ship some seriously impressive projects. From productivity bots to creative AI assistants, the results speak for themselves and so do the numbers.

## Meet the Winners: What They Built

### 1st Place: [MastraBolt AI Agent](https://github.com/Theideabased/agent-challenge)

- **What it does:** A complete visual development platform that allows users to build, test, and deploy AI agents across multiple platforms through a browser-based IDE without coding.

## Trends Weâ€™re Seeing

We noticed a few exciting trends across this roundâ€™s entries:

- **Practical Agent Use Cases** - Builders focused on agents that solve real problems, from content generation, developer tooling, automated trading, market analysis, healthcare, entertainment, and many more.

- **Agent Frameworks** - Developers are eager to learn how to use agents to adopt them to solve their problems

- **CLI-first Development** - Many submissions built directly on top of the nosana-cli, showing just how accessible decentralized compute has become.

- **MCP Usage** - Some developers took the extra step of integrating their agent with MCP capabilities, making their agent even more extensible.

- **Diverse Usecase** - There is a wide range of usecase participants tried to tackle, devtooling, defi Tooling, productivity agents, healthcare, entertainment, supply chain, real estate.
  This shows the growing depth and diversity of the Nosana builder community.

## Community Energy: More Than Just Code

Beyond the GitHub stars and submissions, what really made this edition shine was the community interaction:

- 1,000+ Discord messages
- Builders helping each other debug, deploy, and demo
- Dozens of devs sharing their builds on X and tagging others to join

## 2 Down. 2 To Go. And Then?

With two Builders Challenges behind us, weâ€™re entering the second half of this journey and trust us, itâ€™s not just about challenges.

Weâ€™re halfway through the Builders Challenge series, but this is just the beginning. **Something bigger is brewing**. A new chapter for builders is on the way. And if youâ€™ve been paying attention, you may have already caught the first hints. Challenge 3 might just reveal a little more.

Huge thanks to our partners at [ Superteam ](https://superteam.fun) for supporting creators across the ecosystem. And shoutout to our judges, community moderators, and all the builders who submitted projects.

Whether you were deep in GPU tuning or just lurking in `#challenges-chat`, the challenge created real buzz and weâ€™re grateful for everyone of you who joined the ride.

## Challenge 3 Is Coming. Are You In?
