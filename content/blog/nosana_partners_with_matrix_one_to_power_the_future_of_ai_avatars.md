The landscape of human-computer interaction is evolving rapidly. At the forefront of this transformation is Matrix One, a decentralized platform that empowers users to create and interact with AI-powered avatars. With a rapidly expanding user base, Matrix One is pushing the boundaries of what's possible in the realm of AI avatars.
Nosana is proud to join forces with Matrix One in this exciting journey. This collaboration will leverage Nosana's global compute network to fuel the ever-growing demands of Matrix One's platform.
Letâ€™s dive into this collaboration.

## The Nosana and Matrix One Integration

[Matrix One](https://www.matrix.one/), a rapidly growing AI avatar platform, has recently experienced a surge in user demand, boasting 6,000 daily active users and 60,000 signed-up users on their platform, avatar.one. Currently, Matrix One primarily uses text-to-text generation with Llama 2 and is planning an integration with Llama 3, which will also focus on text-to-text generation. As a decentralized platform, they seek a more reliable decentralized compute solution to power their core services and experiment with newer models.

Matrix One identified Nosana as a viable option to address these needs. By leveraging its vast network of NVIDIA nodes, Matrix One will utilize Nosana's 4090 GPUs to meet specific workload and performance requirements.

Nosana's decentralized network provides Matrix One with a highly scalable and resilient infrastructure. The pay-per-use model allows Matrix One to efficiently allocate GPU resources based on real-time demands, ensuring optimal performance and cost-effectiveness. This flexibility is crucial as Matrix One manages its growing user base and the increasing complexity of its AI avatar models, which are gradually becoming multi-modal.

The integration with Nosana is straightforward, effectively functioning as a compute engine, allowing Matrix One to route jobs to the appropriate GPU market based on their requirements. Nosana's inference network is optimized to meet the demanding response times of less than 2 seconds required by Matrix One's AI avatar platform.

To further streamline deployment for partners like Matrix One, Nosana is developing container images designed for running large language models like Llama 3 on their inference network. These images will encapsulate the necessary dependencies and optimizations, enabling Matrix One to deploy and serve their models to users efficiently.

By leveraging Nosana's decentralized GPU network, Matrix One can overcome the limitations of centralized infrastructure, gaining the scalability, resilience, and cost-efficiency needed to drive innovation in the AI avatar space. With Nosana's support, Matrix One can focus on pushing the boundaries of AI avatar creation without being constrained by the current bottlenecks of the GPU shortage that many centralized providers face.
