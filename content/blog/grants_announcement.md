Every month, AI builders push the boundary of what’s possible \- agents stepping into real workflows, models running continuously in the background, and tools that arrive feeling complete rather than experimental.

The one thing that hasn't kept pace is the infrastructure behind it. Cloud queues stretch longer, inference costs rise, and GPU access remains limited \- it’s a slowdown every builder has felt. Not because of a lack of imagination, but because the overhead gets in the way.

The Nosana Grants Program is designed to close that gap. If you're building products meant for the next phase of AI, you shouldn’t have to wait for better timing or better infrastructure. You should be able to move faster, experiment freely, and ship when the idea is hot \- not years after the momentum fades\!

If you are building for the next phase of AI, you are exactly the kind of builder this program was designed for.

## **What the Nosana Grants Program Is All About**

The Nosana Grants Program is built for people who are genuinely moving the AI space forward.  
If you’re orchestrating agents, training AI/ML models, shaping intelligent infrastructure, creating tooling for builders, designing data pipelines, building launchpads, or experimenting with ideas that don’t fit neatly into a category — this program gives you the backing to build with more freedom and confidence.

Funding ranges from **$5,000 to $50,000 USD** and is released through self-defined milestone stages. You can receive it in **stablecoins, NOS tokens, or compute credits** you can use across the Nosana ecosystem.

**No heavy paperwork.**  
**No long reviews.**  
**Just support that helps you get your work out of your head and into the world.**

# **What Types of Projects Fit the Program?**

**The program is broadly open, but especially aligned with work around:**

- Agent and orchestration systems

- Privacy and verification layers

- Inference and deployment workflows

- LLM-powered applications

- Gen-AI video and creative tools

- Developer tooling for the AI/ML ecosystem

- Data and automation pipelines

- AI/ML model training

- Early-stage or experimental ideas that need room to grow

**If you’re building something fresh, ambitious, or genuinely useful — and Nosana fits into your stack — you’re in the right place. 🔮**

## **Who the Program Is Designed For**

The program is built for the people who keep the AI world moving. The explorers. The tinkerers. The ones who try things just to see what happens.

It is for  
 • Developers and AI builders across the spectrum  
 • Entrepreneurs and Startups  
 • Scale ups exploring new AI capabilities  
 • Open source contributors  
 • Researchers and technical groups  
 • And the dreamers and vibers who treat creation like oxygen

## **What the Program Provides**

The value of the program goes beyond financial support. Teams accepted into the grants program gain access to a focused, structured environment designed to help them deliver and grow.

### **Milestone-Based Financial Support**

Funding is awarded in phases tied to transparent self-defined milestones, offering clarity and predictable progress.

### **Full Ownership and IP Control**

The program is fully non-dilutive. All work, rights, and intellectual property remain with the builders.

### **Visibility Within the Ecosystem**

Selected teams may be featured across Nosana’s ecosystem channels, providing meaningful exposure to a global community of developers and partners.

### **Access to a Supportive Network**

While the program does not include dedicated engineering troubleshooting, teams benefit from light-touch guidance and community support from others working with decentralized compute and AI infrastructure.

## **What Makes a Strong Application**

The review committee evaluates applications with a focus on clarity, feasibility, and genuine alignment with decentralized compute.

Successful applications usually demonstrate:

- A well-thought-out technical approach

- A roadmap with realistic, structured milestones

- Meaningful use of Nosana’s decentralized GPUs

- A team capable of executing their plan

- Potential ecosystem or community impact

Projects don’t need to be polished or finished \- they just need direction, feasibility, and purpose.

## **How the Review Process Works**

**The goal is simple: keep builders building — not filling out unnecessary forms.**

**1\. Submit your application**  
Share your project overview, roadmap, team, how Nosana fits your architecture, and the funding you’re requesting.

**2\. Application review**  
We assess alignment and feasibility. **We may ask for refinements if milestones need more clarity.**

**3\. Define your milestone plan**  
If accepted, you’ll **finalize the milestones and deliverables tied to your grant.**

**4\. Start building**  
Funding is released as you progress through your milestones.

**5\. Ecosystem visibility**  
Exceptional projects may be highlighted across Nosana channels.

## **Example in Practice: Inferia**

Real-world results are the clearest proof of what a decentralized compute can unlock.

[Inferia](https://www.inferia.ai/) \- a research-driven AI tooling startup used Nosana to scale their inference pipelines without the usual constraints of cloud queues and unpredictable GPU availability. After migrating their workflows to the decentralized GPU network, Inferia **cut inference costs by 68%** and achieved a **4× improvement in provisioning speed**, giving their team more bandwidth for experimentation instead of infrastructure management.

As the Inferia team describes it, _“Nosana allowed us to move faster than traditional clouds ever could. We could iterate, deploy, and test without waiting in line for compute.”_

This is exactly the kind of momentum the Nosana Grants Program aims to support — practical acceleration that lets teams build at the speed of their ideas.

Sjoerd Dijkstra, Co-Founder of Nosana, captures the spirit of the program best:

**“At Nosana, we're fueling the builders who will define the future of decentralized compute. The Nosana Grants Program empowers innovators to push boundaries and bring bold ideas to life.”**

When experimentation is no longer limited by cost, queues, or compute bottlenecks, teams like Inferia can move from idea to implementation without losing momentum \- the same freedom Nosana wants every grant recipient to experience\!

Reach out anytime, we’re here to help: **grants@nosana.ai**

The future of AI won’t be shaped by a few companies. It will be shaped by the builders \- the ones experimenting, creating, and believing in a more open, accessible AI ecosystem.  
The Nosana Grants Program is here to help those builders move faster.
