From major network milestones to new tooling for builders, global community moments, and a full year of the GPU Marketplace in production, the Nosana ecosystem continues to scale in all the ways that matter.

Let’s dive in 👇

## **🔓 New Milestones Unlocked: 3M Jobs & 3M Job Hours**

We’ve officially crossed **3 million completed jobs** and **3 million job hours** on the Nosana Network.

That’s millions of times someone:

* Ran a model  
* Tested an idea  
* Experimented, iterated, and shipped  
* Pushed a project one step closer to production

These numbers represent real usage, real workloads, and a growing community choosing decentralized GPU compute \- again and again.

**Onward.**

## **🧭 Team Offsite in Spain \+ Looking Ahead to 2026**

We wrapped up an intense and energizing team offsite in Spain, bringing almost the entire remote-first team together.

A lot of time was spent:

* Reconnecting as humans  
* Aligning as a team  
* Going deep on what Nosana should look like in **2026 and beyond**

Focused, aligned, and ready to build what’s next.
