December didn’t just close the year, it **validated the network**\! Real GPU workloads, builders shipping in production, and milestones that matter\!

Here’s what we shipped 👇

### **🔓 New Milestone Unlocked**

**$2M+ in total network earnings**

Nosana has crossed **$2 million in total earnings** across the network.

This milestone reflects the work of builders deploying workloads, hosts running GPUs, and contributors pushing the network forward. Thank you to everyone building, testing, and shipping with us\!

### **🧪 Builders’ Challenge \#3 — Recap**

Agents are evolving fast, and Builders’ Challenge \#3 showed just how far experimentation can go.

Fresh ideas, clever implementations, and genuinely fun agent concepts came out of this round.

### **📊 2025 Wrapped**

Mainnet running. Builders shipping workloads. GPUs powering AI and science.

**Year-End Snapshot**

December marked a shift from shipping features to seeing them used.

The network crossed meaningful economic milestones, builders deployed real GPU workloads, and multiple parts of the stack matured at the same time — from wallet-native onboarding and grants, to inference tooling and SDK upgrades. Alongside this, Nosana’s ecosystem continued to grow through new integrations, technical releases, and deeper engagement across the Solana builder community.

These pieces are now working together in practice. December wasn’t about isolated updates, but about the system operating as a whole, with builders actively building on it.

As we head into the new year 🎉  
 thank you to everyone building, hosting, and contributing to Nosana 🙌  
 We’re excited to keep pushing forward in 2026 — and wish you a focused, productive, and successful year ahead 🚀
