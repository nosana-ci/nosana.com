**Singapore Highlights \- TOKEN2049 Week** 

Our biggest moment this month was Nosana BUIDL Day \- an AI Agent Hackathon that drew 400+ sign-ups and a full room of builders deploying live, working agents on decentralized GPUs.   
The momentum was clear \- real demand, real experimentation, real progress.   
We have also joined a series of builder-first gatherings across the city:   
* AI x Web3 Builders Happy Hour — connecting founders, researchers, and emerging teams.  
* Dreamhaus: Render the Future — with Sogni AI, TZ APAC, Nosana, and OpenGPU, rounding out the week as F1 weekend began
