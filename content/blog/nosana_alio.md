As agentic LLMs become more autonomous, securing them becomes critical.

Alio is an independent AI security lab building **Alio Firewall**, a system designed to detect, evaluate, and mitigate risks in agentic LLMs. Their work depends on running large-scale simulations, red-teaming exercises, and model validation pipelines, all of which require reliable, scalable GPU compute.

To support this workload, Alio partnered with **Nosana GPU Cloud**, gaining access to on-demand, cost-efficient GPUs without long-term infrastructure commitments.

### The Challenge: Scaling AI Security Workloads

Building AI security infrastructure is compute-intensive by nature.

Alio needed to:

* Train and validate LLM risk detection models  
* Run large-scale red-teaming simulations  
* Stress-test agentic behaviors across multiple scenarios  
* Scale workloads dynamically based on testing demand

Traditional cloud solutions made this difficult due to **high costs**, **rigid pricing**, and **limited flexibility** for burst workloads.

## **Why Nosana**

Nosana’s GPU Cloud offered Alio a different approach.

With Nosana, Alio gets:

* **On-demand GPU access** without long-term lock-ins  
* **Lower compute costs** compared to traditional providers  
* **Flexible scaling** for intensive, short-lived workloads  
* **Developer-friendly infrastructure** designed for AI teams

This allows Alio to focus on **securing agentic systems**, not managing infrastructure.

## **How Alio Uses Nosana GPU Cloud**

Alio uses Nosana GPUs to power:

* LLM risk detection model training  
* Validation of AI safety mechanisms  
* Large-scale red-teaming simulations  
* Performance testing under adversarial conditions

By spinning up GPU jobs only when needed, Alio can run complex experiments efficiently and cost-effectively.

## **The Result**

Using Nosana GPU Cloud, Alio can:

* Scale AI security testing without prohibitive costs  
* Iterate faster on LLM safety models  
* Run broader and deeper red-teaming simulations  
* Allocate more resources to research and innovation

This partnership enables Alio to push forward AI safety research while maintaining full control over compute usage.

## **Looking Ahead**

As agentic AI systems continue to evolve, the need for robust security tooling will only grow.

By combining **Alio’s AI security expertise** with **Nosana’s decentralized GPU Cloud**, both teams are contributing to a more resilient and secure AI ecosystem.
