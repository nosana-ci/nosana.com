Today, Nosana is proud to partner with OpenGPU, a high-performance compute network that provides a routing and execution layer for AI workloads. 

This partnership marks an important step toward a more flexible AI ecosystem, where builders and enterprises can access scalable compute without relying solely on traditional cloud providers.

## **How OpenGPU operates today**

OpenGPU operates as a routing and execution layer for AI workloads, with Relay serving as the main abstraction that builders and enterprises interact with.

Through this architecture, OpenGPU coordinates and routes compute tasks across a distributed network of providers, optimizing for performance, cost, and reliability. Developers can submit workloads through Relay without needing to manage the underlying infrastructure or manually select individual compute providers.

To support this model, OpenGPU relies on a reliable and diverse supply of GPU compute that can be dynamically routed and executed across its network.

## **Nosana’s role in powering OpenGPU**

This is where Nosana plays a critical role.

Nosana is a key part of the decentralized compute supply that OpenGPU routes and executes workloads across. By integrating with Nosana’s open protocol, OpenGPU gains access to a scalable, distributed GPU network that strengthens its routing and execution layer.

In practice, this means that OpenGPU can route workloads across Nosana’s compute infrastructure through Relay, while builders and enterprises continue to interact with OpenGPU at a higher level of abstraction. Nosana contributes resilient, high-performance compute capacity that supports OpenGPU’s broader system.

This clear division of roles allows both platforms to focus on what they do best: OpenGPU as the coordination, routing, and execution layer, and Nosana as a core provider of distributed GPU compute.

## **What this means for builders and users**

For developers and AI builders, this collaboration simplifies access to scalable compute. Instead of manually selecting infrastructure providers, users can submit workloads through OpenGPU’s Relay layer, which intelligently routes tasks across available compute, including Nosana’s network.

This creates greater flexibility in how AI workloads are executed, improves reliability through distributed compute supply, and fosters a more competitive environment for AI infrastructure. Over time, this reduces dependence on centralized cloud providers and supports a more open ecosystem for innovation.

## **What’s next**

This partnership is an important step in expanding access to AI compute, but it is only the beginning.

As the integration deepens, Nosana and OpenGPU will continue to improve performance, scalability, and usability for builders relying on modern AI infrastructure. By connecting OpenGPU’s routing and execution layer with Nosana’s compute network, the collaboration creates more choice and flexibility for developers working with AI.

We are excited to see how the community builds on top of this partnership and how it contributes to a more open, competitive, and accessible AI ecosystem.

Stay tuned for more updates as this partnership evolves.
