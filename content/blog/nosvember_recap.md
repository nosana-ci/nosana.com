Throughout November, Nostronauts showed up with creativity, collaboration, humor, and skill, helping turn every challenge, competition, and community moment into something uniquely Nosana. This year’s Nosvember wasn’t just bigger; it was *louder, funnier, more collaborative*, and filled with brand-new faces contributing in brand-new ways.

This recap brings together the highlights of the month, our favorite community moments, the winners across all events, and a spotlight on the champions pushing the ecosystem forward.

## A Month of Events, Activities & Challenges

Nosvember 2025 brought back the familiar favorites while introducing new quests and ways for the community to engage. Here’s a look at everything that went down:

## We played some games

We played [Sketchful.io](http://Sketchful.io) twice this month, where we shared a lot of funny drawings and showed off our Picassoeque talents (most were far from it)

The quiz had a lot of big brains and OGs around. Questions varied from entry-level to straight up ancient knowledge of how Nosana came to existence. We had a lot of fun with this one, counting over 45 attendants.

Poker had some strong hands this month, with over 210 participants, the competition was very fierce. We threw cards around all evening, with 5 winners being crowned in the end. 

## The laughs we share

We held a meme contest to see what the community has to offer, and they did not dissappoint\! With over 40 submissions on X, we’ve had work to do to choose our favorite 5, including even a rap song\!.  
Here is one of them:

## Writing and learning together

Our thread contest lasted for 2 weeks, and it for sure did not disappoint. Creators, writers, and educators from the community stepped up and shared their perspectives on Nosana, from agent use cases to broader ecosystem insights.

Our top 3 threads can be seen and read here:

## We have more Frens now

Our Hello Frens contest was getting noticed, as we’ve seen over 500 invites come in across the board. After a little cleansing and some extra checks, we’ve crowned our top 3 who brought the most amount on Frens to our lovely Discord. 

Onto more community growth\!

## Community Champions

Every year, we recognize the individuals who consistently uplift, support, and grow the Nosana ecosystem \- through code, content, engagement, leadership, or simply being a positive presence.

This year’s Champions brought unmatched energy across the board.

## From the Nosana Team, thank you.

Nosvember isn’t about prizes, it’s about the energy, creativity, and community spirit you bring.  
Every message, drawing, meme, thread, quiz answer, and invite helped shape what this month became.
