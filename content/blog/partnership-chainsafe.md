Nosana’s principal solution is to provide a crowd-based computational platform that will power the Metaverse and Web3 applications consistently and reliably during this next internet revolution. Our blockchain-based architecture allows anybody to purchase and sell computing power in a decentralized environment. On the Nosana Platform, computational nodes will be able to leverage consumer CPUs to run their CICD infrastructure, which is crucial for organizations to ship software quickly and efficiently today and tomorrow.

In ChainSafe we found a great partner that shares our vision for a decentralized, secure and reliable CICD future. We take this opportunity to play an important role in bringing decentralized CICD testing to their product very seriously and will do our best to be a good long-term partner. Part of the value we provide is helping them manage the complexities of integrating new code for development and operations teams, allowing ChainSafe to fully focus on their core product. We’re excited to be working together and look forward to helping them build and test, with as little interference along the way. Nosana will develop a tailored static-code-analysis pipeline for a selection of repositories from ChainSafe. They will get direct access to a dashboard where they can review the results of the Nosana pipelines.

One of the repositories that we’re building a tailored static-code-analysis pipeline for is web3.js. Web3.js is considered to be one of Ethereum’s most recognizable and used Javascript tools and libraries. It is a collection of modules that allow you to interact with a local or remote Ethereum node using HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket. With over 200,000 downloads per week, there is no doubt that we can have a huge impact if we help them build a truly decentralized CICD interface.
