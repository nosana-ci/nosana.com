### How to Stake in the NOS-USDC Ecosystem Pool?
1. Go to the [farm](https://raydium.io/farms/?tab=Ecosystem&farmid=13dsYRhzpfKiH1mi6UXsJZzKiRwm4ad1SxYBezMLAGqd) and connect your wallet.

2. Click the NOS-USDC Pair to open its drop-down section, then click on the pair link to add liquidity (highlighted in green below). Raydium provides a detailed [guide](https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/liquidity-providers/liquidity-pools/raydium-farms) to help you understand how to add liquidity. Once you have completed the steps to add liquidity, return to the Ecosystem section and find the pair again.

3. Once you have added liquidity and have Liquidity Pool (LP tokens) in your wallet, click 'Stake LP' in the NOS-USDC drop-down section to start farming. If you are stuck, you can reference this [guide](https://docs.raydium.io/raydium/liquidity-providers/liquidity-pools/raydium-farms), which explains adding liquidity and obtaining LP tokens.

4. Enter the amount you wish to stake or select 'MAX' to stake all LP tokens. Then click 'Confirm'.

5. Make sure you approve the transaction in your wallet; you will need some Solana tokens in your wallet for any fees.

After the transaction is confirmed, you should be staked and now earning $NOS on our farm by providing liquidity to the pool!
