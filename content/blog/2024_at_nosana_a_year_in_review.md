This past year has been nothing short of transformative for Nosana. Itâ€™s been a year of growth, innovation, and relentless hard work as we move closer to realizing the future of decentralized AI compute. With the Mainnet launch just weeks away, it feels like the right time to reflect on the milestones that have defined 2024.

**The Test Grid: A Truly Global Network**

One of the most significant achievements of 2024 has been the evolution of the [Test Grid](https://nosana.com/blog/test_grid_phase_2_update) into a truly global network. With over a million inference hours completed and nearly a thousand nodes onboarded from 47 countries, the grid has demonstrated the immense potential of decentralized infrastructure.

Behind these numbers lies a [global network of diverse GPUs](https://dashboard.nosana.com/markets) working together to power real-world applications. More than just data points, they symbolize the power of collaboration, creativity, and a shared vision of what decentralization can achieve.

**Building Smarter Infrastructure**

Scaling isnâ€™t enough on its ownâ€”it needs to be paired with thoughtful improvements. Thatâ€™s why 2024 was also about making Nosana smarter, faster, and more user-friendly.

One major milestone was the introduction of Nosana Node V2. This complete rewrite of our node software brought significant performance improvements, making the network more adaptable and robust. Features like enhanced APIs and a redesigned web socket architecture have set a new standard for what decentralized infrastructure can deliver.

We also revamped the [Leaderboard](https://leaderboard.nosana.com/) and [Dashboard](https://dashboard.nosana.com/) to make interacting with nodes seamless and intuitive. By focusing on usability, weâ€™re ensuring that anyone, from experienced developers to newcomers, can easily onboard and navigate the grid.

**LLM Research and Benchmarking**

We know AI needs compute power, but how efficient can different GPUs be? In 2024, we found out.

By researching and benchmarking Large Language Models (LLMs) on our grid, we learned a lot about performance and cost. These [insights](https://nosana.com/blog/llm_benchmarking_cost_efficient_performance) donâ€™t just help usâ€”they help you and the wider AI community.

In 2024, Nosana's innovative approach to decentralized GPU cloud computing garnered significant attention within the research community. Here are some of the notable contributions that were published:

- [**Grayscale Investments Report**](https://www.grayscale.com/research/reports/ai-is-coming-crypto-can-help-make-it-right)
- [**Binance Research**](https://www.binance.com/en/research/analysis/industry-map-mar24)
- [**Messari**](https://messari.io/report/are-gpu-compute-networks-supply-or-demand-constrained)

**Strategic Partnerships**

This year, collaboration has been a big part of what we do at Nosana. Weâ€™ve worked with companies like [Sogni](https://nosana.com/blog/nosana_partners_with_sogni_ai_to_empower_creativity_through_ai_powered_art_generation) to support creatives with AI-powered tools, teamed up with [Aurory](https://nosana.com/blog/nosana_and_aurory_partner_to_create_unique_ai_powered_gaming_experiences) to explore new ideas in gaming, and partnered with [Theoriq](https://nosana.com/blog/nosana_partners_with_theoriq_to_foster_frictionless_ai_innovation) to drive innovation in Web3, among others. These are just a few examples of whatâ€™s possible when decentralized GPUs are put to work. Our growing network of collaborators is helping shape a future where technology is more accessible and impactful for everyone.

**A Global Stage for Decentralized AI**

In 2024, Nosana didnâ€™t just stay behind the scenes. Our team traveled the world, sharing what weâ€™re building and meeting people who care about the future of AI. We participated in **11 global events**, connecting with innovators, creators, and businesses.

Some highlights include:

**Solana Breakpoint in Singapore:** Talking about the [future of blockchain and decentralized computing](https://youtu.be/-9NxMjU6eew?feature=shared).

At the **World Summit AI** in Amsterdam, our co-founder, Jesse Eisses, talked about ["Powering the AI Revolution: Nosanaâ€™s Global Decentralized GPU Network."](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36HUBr4i1ZA)

**AI x DePIN Networking Breakfast hosted by Nosana:** Bringing creators and developers together to share ideas and collaborate.

These events werenâ€™t just about showing what we doâ€”they were about learning, listening, and finding new ways to make AI compute more accessible for everyone.

Beyond in-person events, we participated in online discussions:

- [**Unleashing DePIN**](https://youtu.be/id2k-Oaj4yg)
- [**Building Web3 Podcast**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opkcmNGvnz0)
- [**We Are DePIN**](https://youtu.be/RREf0U2lNpE?si=J-WI5tg28FH5DrNP)
- [**The 10AM Pro**](https://youtu.be/Rmcgd-xeee4?feature=shared)

These engagements allowed us to learn, listen, and explore new ways to make AI compute more accessible for everyone.

**Looking Ahead**

As we prepare for 2025, our focus shifts towards the [Mainnet](https://nosana.com/blog/road_to_mainnet_nosanas_next_chapter) launch. This isnâ€™t just a technical milestoneâ€”itâ€™s the start of a new chapter for Nosana and the ecosystem weâ€™re building. Features like dynamic job-to-node matching, a fully decentralized GPU grid, and an expanded suite of tools will open up new possibilities for developers and businesses alike.

2024 has been a year of laying the foundation, testing, and dreaming big. The journey has been as rewarding as the destination, and weâ€™re grateful to everyoneâ€”our team, our community, and our partnersâ€”who made it possible.

Weâ€™re excited to keep building a more accessible, decentralized future for AI compute in 2025.
