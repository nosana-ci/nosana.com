## **Nosana and [Sogni.AI](http://sogni.ai/) Team Up**

[Sogni.AI](http://sogni.ai/)  provides AI art and image generation tool for artists and creatives, both professional and personal. Unlike the "casual prompting" web tools previously available Sogni runs as a IOS or macOS applications with deep workflow tools akin to an Adobe product but without the monthly subscription fees or heavy handed restrictions. These apps enable users to express their creativity by generating art from prompts and fine-tuning them through an intuitive interface. With over 100 purpose specific art generation models available, Sogni brings creative vision to life the way the artist intended with pixel perfect precision.

Previously, when users downloaded the Sogni app, art generation took place locally, which meant dealing with large, slow models. This often resulted in delays, limiting the creative flow. Now, by partnering with Nosana, Sogni can offer a faster, more streamlined experience by offloading the computationally heavy work to Nosana’s decentralized network of GPU nodes.

## **How Nosana and Sogni Work Together**

Running Stable Diffusion models efficiently requires powerful GPUs, which is where Nosana excels. Through its decentralized GPU grid, Nosana provides the computing power Sogni needs to run Stable Diffusion models quickly and affordably.

Each Stable Diffusion model is trained to produce specific outcomes, from pixelated art to photo realistic images. Within Sogni, users can select from a variety of models to generate images tailored to their preferences. Additionally, the app offers an array of photo editing tools, allowing users to iterate on their creations seamlessly.

With Nosana’s GPU network, Sogni users no longer have to wait for lengthy local processing times. Instead, they can offload the art generation process to Nosana’s decentralized infrastructure, producing stunning visuals within seconds. This integration empowers users to explore multiple iterations and creative options in real time, enhancing their creative journey.

## **Looking Ahead**

This partnership between Nosana and [Sogni.AI](http://sogni.ai/) marks a major milestone in the world of creative technology. By combining Nosana’s decentralized compute network with Sogni’s advanced art generation and editing tools, they are redefining what’s possible in digital creativity.

As the partnership evolves, both teams are excited to continue pushing the boundaries of AI-powered creativity, bringing innovative features and seamless performance to artists and creators across the globe.

With Nosana powering the next generation of creative tools, the future of digital art is in good hands.
