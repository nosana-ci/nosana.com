Today’s cloud computing infrastructure cannot keep up with the demands of our technology-driven society. Our current internet infrastructure — based on centralized services provided by cloud computing providers like Amazon Web Services AWS — may be subject to downtime and leaving users of platforms that rely on it completely stranded and at the mercy of tech giants.

As a result of cryptocurrencies being provided as a form of decentralized finance, blockchain made its first step into the mainstream. Beyond cryptocurrency, blockchain technology is having a significant impact on a wide range of sectors, including property investment, production lines, valuable metals, and art. In addition to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology is increasingly gaining the respect it deserves as a disruptive force of epic proportions in the IT world.

For cloud computing companies, blockchain technology is beginning to change the game by providing a solution for accessing computing resources without actually owning those resources, much in the same way that Lyft and Vrbo’s business models allow access to transportation and assets without actually owning those assets.

[Nosana,](https://nosana.io/) a blockchain-based decentralized crowd computing platform, aims to bring the disruptive power of blockchain technology to the field of application development for all types of apps. We recently announced that ChainSafe will be joining our testnet. We are aiding them in developing a customized static-code-analysis pipeline for a selection of ChainSafe repositories by leveraging distributed computing.

It’s interesting to note that centralized cloud computing businesses such as Amazon’s AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud have retained tight dominance over the sector. Because these centralized firms in the cloud computing field have a kind of monopoly on the market, they are able to utilize the pricing of their cloud computing services as a lever to dominate the market.

The more concerning aspect is that there is a rapidly increasing need for computer resources, across all sectors, which will be required to feed mass-market use now, and in the future. Companies and tech organizations cannot afford to assume the duty of expanding their existing CPU-based data centers in order to keep up with the increasing demands. The reality is that even with exponential development, CPUs in these data centers will be unable to cope with the exponential growth over the next decade.

It’s time for a change. Are you ready to be a part of it?
