## **Introduction**

Inferia began with a clear observation. AI models were advancing rapidly, but the experience of putting them into production was not evolving at the same pace. The founders believed deploying a model should feel as simple and seamless as publishing a website. With this vision in mind and with Nosana’s decentralized GPU network as the foundation, they set out to create a new kind of deployment experience.

One that is fast, intuitive, and accessible to developers who want to focus on building rather than managing infrastructure.

Today, that idea is already a reality. Inferia gives developers the ability to deploy any model in under sixty seconds, making the path from prototype to production smoother than ever\!

## **The Problem, Defined Clearly and Constructively**

As AI continues to grow, a new challenge has emerged. Creating a model has become easier, but running it reliably in production still involves a series of technical steps that require time and attention. None of these steps are unnecessary, they simply take effort that many teams would rather invest in the product itself.

Developers often need to select the right GPU, prepare the environment, configure containers, manage networking, monitor performance, and keep costs predictable. These tasks are essential, yet they do not need to slow innovation.

Inferia recognized an opportunity to streamline this entire process. By using Nosana’s decentralized GPU network and designing intelligent automation around it, they created a workflow that removes complexity while preserving flexibility. Developers can now deploy confidently without the burden of building and maintaining the underlying infrastructure themselves.

The result is a deployment experience that matches the pace of modern AI development and gives builders the freedom to move quickly from idea to production.

## **How Developers Use [Inferia](https://www.inferia.ai/): Sixty Seconds to Production**

Inferia designed one of the closest experiences to a Vercel-style deployment flow for AI models. Everything is streamlined so developers can launch a model without touching infrastructure.

### **The Workflow**

1. **Connect Wallet**  
   Users connect their Phantom wallet and begin immediately \- no registration, no email, no account creation.

2. **Select Model**  
   Developers browse Inferia’s curated catalog or choose from more than two million models available on Hugging Face.

3. **Auto Configuration**  
   Inferia analyzes the model and automatically selects the optimal GPU from Nosana’s network, from RTX 3060s to H100s.

4. **Deploy**  
   A single click begins deployment. Developers watch logs in real time as the model is downloaded, the container initializes, and the endpoint prepares.

5. **Production API**  
   Each deployment produces an OpenAI-compatible API, a testing interface, real-time monitoring, and cost tracking.

### **Drop-In Integration**

Switching from OpenAI to an Inferia endpoint requires changing just one line of code:

`# Before:`  
`client = OpenAI(base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1")`

`# After:`  
`client = OpenAI(base_url="https://your-inferia-endpoint.com/v1")`

### **Fair and Transparent Billing**

Developers pay only for actual usage.

* Unused time is automatically refunded.

* Test deployments cost only a few cents.

* No unexpected charges.

* No long-term commitments.

## **How Inferia Was Built**

Inferia was not created by a large team with unlimited resources. It was built by developers who understood the challenge because they had lived it themselves. Their goal was not to build infrastructure. Their goal was to build a product that made AI deployment accessible for everyone.

### **Finding the Right Infrastructure**

The team evaluated multiple options. Traditional cloud providers offered power but with high cost and complexity. GPU vendors required long-term commitments. Managed AI platforms lacked flexibility.

None of these aligned with Inferia’s vision for fast iteration and experimentation.

Nosana provided something different—a decentralized network offering lower costs, high flexibility, and transparent access to heterogeneous GPUs. More importantly, it reflected a builder-first philosophy.

Inferia described the value clearly:

“They were creating infrastructure that matched how we work. It was accessible, transparent, and built with a real understanding of what developers need.”

### **More Than Compute Access**

When Inferia connected with Nosana, they gained more than GPUs. They gained a partner.

They received:

* Stable compute for long development cycles

* Hands-on engineering support

* Freedom to experiment without financial pressure

* Direct connection to a community of other builders

The partnership accelerated Inferia’s progress in a way that traditional providers could not match.

## **The Results**

Over months of development, Inferia achieved outcomes that many teams struggle to deliver even with much larger budgets:

* Deployments that complete in sixty seconds

* A sixty-nine percent reduction in inference costs via optimized GPU matching

* Four times faster provisioning through Nosana’s distributed storage

* Access to more than two million Hugging Face models

* OpenAI-compatible APIs requiring no migration work

As the Inferia team explained:

> “Decentralization does not need to add complexity. When designed well, it simplifies everything.”

## **What the Inferia Team Says**

> “Inferia exists to make deploying AI models as simple as deploying a website \- fast, predictable, and developer-first. Nosana has been an integral part of that mission. Their decentralized GPU network gave us the freedom, flexibility, and reliability we needed to build the fastest model-deployment platform in the industry. We chose Nosana because they move like builders, not bureaucrats, fast, collaborative, and deeply aligned with real developer pain. This is only the beginning of what we’ll build together.”  
> — **Inferia Team**

## **What This Means for Builders**

Inferia demonstrates what is possible when small, focused teams are supported with modern tooling and decentralized infrastructure. A single team can create global-scale impact without carrying the weight of heavy DevOps work.

Ideas move faster. Testing cycles shrink. More of the energy goes into the product rather than the pipeline.

This is exactly the type of progress the Nosana Grants Program aims to support—giving builders compute, support, and room to ship new ideas without facing infrastructure limitations.

---

## **Looking Ahead**

The collaboration between Inferia and Nosana is the result of months of shared engineering work and continuous iteration. Both teams contributed insights, feedback, and improvements that shaped the platform into what it is today.

And this is only the beginning.

Inferia is not just a partner in the ecosystem, it is also built on top of internal technology that Nosana has been evolving. More information about this work will be shared very soon.

Developers can expect exciting announcements in the coming weeks as the next chapter of this collaboration unfolds.

> “We're thrilled to see Inferia building on Nosana exactly as we envisioned. They're not just deploying AI models, they're inspiring developers everywhere to rethink what's possible with decentralized infrastructure. This partnership perfectly showcases the potential of DePIN.”  
>**‐ Jesse Eisses, Co-Founder Nosana**

## **Inferia Founding Team Background**

### **About the Founder**

Inferia was founded by **Piyush Choudhary**, a product-focused builder and engineer with years of experience creating high-performance AI systems, developer tools, and infrastructure products.

Before Inferia, Piyush spent years building AI-powered platforms across analytics, design automation, agent systems, and model-lifecycle pipelines, gaining firsthand experience with the painful reality of deploying AI models at scale.

This frustration with fragmented DevOps, unpredictable GPU infrastructure, and slow iteration cycles became the origin story of Inferia.

### **Experience & Expertise**

The founding team brings deep experience across:

* AI infrastructure & model lifecycles

* Developer tooling & automation

* Distributed systems & high-performance APIs

* Real-world production workflows

* GPU orchestration & multi-provider compute

### **Origin Story**

Inferia began with a simple question:

**Why does deploying an AI model feel 10× harder than building it?**

The team saw researchers, founders, and enterprises repeatedly hitting the same bottleneck—not model quality, but deployment complexity. Inferia was created to eliminate that friction entirely.

A platform where any model can go from **notebook → production API in under 60 seconds**.

### **Funding Status**

Inferia is independently built and funded, supported by early ecosystem partners and infrastructure providers such as Nosana. More strategic partners and compute networks will be onboarded as the platform expands.

Inferia’s story is still unfolding, but its foundation is clear: a team that understands the pain, a platform designed around speed and simplicity, and a partnership with Nosana that accelerates what a small, focused group of builders can achieve.

Together, they’re redefining what AI deployment can feel like \- not a hurdle, but a moment of momentum\!
