Starting now, anyone with a compatible GPU can register as a host on our network, and AI companies can access the decentralized compute marketplace we’ve built.

### A Mission to Share GPUs
At Nosana, we believe GPUs should be a shared resource, reducing costs and barriers for businesses and individuals using AI. Over the past few months, we’ve met companies struggling to manage overpriced GPU expenses and researchers unable to find suitable hardware for their AI workloads. These challenges reinforced the need for a decentralized solution, and Nosana delivers exactly that: an affordable, efficient GPU marketplace optimized for AI inference workloads.

### A Year of Testing and Refinement
One year ago, we launched the first decentralized GPU marketplace for a closed group of testers. During this time, we tested and refined the network to meet the demands of modern AI workloads. As AI adoption grows, affordable and accessible compute power is critical to avoiding a future dominated by centralized control and siloed infrastructure. Nosana’s approach leverages consumer GPUs distributed globally to break these barriers.

### Built for Quality and Scalability

##### Quality Checks

Every GPU host joining Nosana must complete performance benchmarks before entering a Community Market. Proven hosts are upgraded to Premium Markets, serving workloads at higher returns. Ongoing performance tests developed by our R&D lab ensure reliable results, maintaining high standards for AI inference while allowing the network to scale efficiently.

##### Dynamic Pricing
Our dynamic pricing model adjusts frequently to reflect market conditions. This approach keeps GPU costs competitive for AI companies while providing consistent income for GPU hosts. Check out our [price calculator](/clients#calculator) and [GPU pricing list](https://dashboard.nosana.com/markets) for details.

##### Explorer and Tools
The updated Nosana dashboard shows real-time Premium Market availability and lets users run compute jobs directly. AI companies ready for production workloads can contact us to [book a demo](https://calendly.com/d/cqxc-9nr-9s5).


## Partnerships That Drive Innovation
Over the past year, we’ve partnered with companies that demonstrate the flexibility of Nosana’s decentralized GPU network. [Matrix One](https://nosana.com/blog/nosana_partners_with_matrix_one_to_power_the_future_of_ai_avatars/), [PiKNiK](https://nosana.com/blog/nosana_teams_up_with_piknik_to_integrate_high_performance_gpus_into_its_depin_network/), and [Sogni.AI](https://nosana.com/blog/nosana_partners_with_sogni_ai_to_empower_creativity_through_ai_powered_art_generation/) are just a few of the organizations using our platform for tasks like AI-powered avatars, enterprise cloud infrastructure, and stable diffusion processing. These partnerships prove that sharing GPU resources can solve real problems across industries.

## A New Chapter for AI Innovation
By breaking down the cost and access barriers that have slowed AI innovation, businesses, researchers, and individuals can now access the GPU resources they need without relying on centralized providers. At Nosana, we believe in a future with no limits, only possibilities—and we’re excited to see how a decentralized approach to AI compute will make that future a reality.
