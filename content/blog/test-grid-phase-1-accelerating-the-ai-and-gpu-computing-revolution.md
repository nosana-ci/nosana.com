### Opening Doors to AI and GPU Computing

The launch of our Test Grid represents a significant moment in AI and GPU-compute technology. We are inviting developers, data scientists, and AI enthusiasts to join the world's most extensive GPU-compute grid. Participants in this groundbreaking project not only have the opportunity to advance in AI technology but also stand a chance to earn a share of 3 million $NOS tokens.

## The Nosana Node: Your Connection to Innovation

Running a Nosana Node with a NVIDIA GPU is essential for registration. Given its pre-release status, it is recommended to operate the Node in a clean environment or virtual machine using a Solana address with minimal SOL​​.

## Hardware and Software Requirements

A system with a minimum of 4GB RAM and a supported NVIDIA GPU is required. The range of compatible GPUs, including models like the NVIDIA RTX 4090 and RTX 4080, ensures robust processing capabilities​​. The software setup includes Ubuntu (20.04 or higher) or Windows with Ubuntu 22.04 on WSL2, Docker, Podman (for WSL2), NVIDIA Drivers, NVIDIA Container Toolkit, and the Solana Tool Suite​​.

## Step-by-Step Guide for Seamless Integration and Registration

### Step 1: Installation and Setup
> * Install the necessary software for the Nosana Node on your system.
> * Follow the provided instructions for installing the Nosana Node on your operating system in our [comprehensive guide](https://docs.nosana.io/nodes/grid.html). We support Windows (WSL2) and Linux users. 
> * Now you are prepared for the next steps in the registration process.

### Step 2: Generating the Registration Code
> * Run the script mentioned in the guide to run the Test Grid registration task on your system.
> * After this, you will receive a unique registration code that you will need to paste into the form later on.
> * Make sure to make a backup of your node's private key, as mentioned in the [guide](https://docs.nosana.io/nodes/grid.html). This is the account that is granted access to the Test Grid and will be receiving the rewards.

### Step 3: Registration Process
> * Utilize the generated registration code to fill out the [registration form](https://forms.gle/d6Copk6W4TAMDY5n8).
> * Complete the remaining fields of the form so we know where to reach you, and leave valuable feedback to the Nosana team if needed. 
> * Submit the completed registration form to initiate the registration process. 

### Step 4: Confirmation Email
> * Expect to receive a confirmation email after submitting the registration form.
> * This email confirms that your registration process is underway.

### Step 5: Phase 1 Notification
> * Prior to the Test Grid launch, you will receive an email notifying you if you have been selected for Phase 1.

### Step 6: Ready for Test Grid
> * Upon completion of the process and receiving confirmation, you are now prepared to actively participate in the Test Grid as a valuable member.

Follow these steps diligently to ensure a smooth integration process and successful registration into the Test Grid.
