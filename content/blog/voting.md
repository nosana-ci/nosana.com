Last month we introduced **NNP-0001**, a proposal to realign NOS rewards with behaviors that strengthen the Nosana network \- reliable capacity, consistent service, and recurring workloads. We’re now moving into governance. This post explains **timeline, eligibility, and the voting procedure** so every holder knows how to participate.

## **Key dates (CET)**

* **Thursday November 13th — 12:00 CET**  
  Snapshot of all eligible holders

* **Monday, November 17 — 12:00 CET → Friday, November 21 — 12:00 CET**  
  On-chain voting window

* **Friday, November 21 — 18:00 CET**  
  Results published

Your voting weight is based on your $NOS balance **at snapshot time**.  This includes tokens that are staked, or in the process of unstaking.

## **Who is eligible**

* **Eligible:** all NOS **holders, stakers, and unstakers**. 

* **Excluded:** Nosana-controlled tokens (e.g., treasury, team reserves, grant pools).

* After the snapshot, we’ll publish the **total eligible voting pool** for transparency.

**CEX reminder:** If your NOS is on a centralized exchange and you want to vote, **move it to a supported SPL wallet before the snapshot**. Balances on exchanges at snapshot time can’t be counted. The same goes for DeFi protocols, such as providing liquidity on Raydium, you will only be able to vote with tokens in your SPL wallet.

**Vote weight:** **1 NOS \= 1 vote**.

## **How to vote**

1. **During the voting window**, go to **vote.nosana.com**.

2. **Connect** the SPL wallet that held your NOS at snapshot time.

3. Your **personal voting weight** will be shown automatically.

4. Cast your vote on **NNP-0001**: **YES** (adopt) or **NO** (reject). Votes are final once submitted.

## **What you’re deciding**

NNP-0001 redirects NOS rewards toward **measurable contribution**—uptime, reliability, and returning usage, so emissions purchase real availability and trust on the network. Full specifications, formulas, and parameters are published for community review. Find out more [here.](https://nosana.com/blog/tokenomics-proposal) 

## **Prepare in advance**

* Review the full proposal on [GitHub.](https://github.com/nosana-ci/network-proposals/blob/main/nnp/NNP-0001-tokenomics.md)

* Join the discussion in Discord.

* If needed, **move tokens off exchanges before the snapshot**.

Implementation will proceed **only if approved by governance**.
