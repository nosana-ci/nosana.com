# **Ocada uses Nosana to power its AI agents on Solana, transforming blockchain user experience**

**Nosana’s partnership with Ocada is unlocking a new era of AI-powered blockchain innovation—from automated trading and security analysis to transforming and simplifying the blockchain user experience.**

## **Introduction**

Ocada, built on Solana like Nosana, is revolutionizing blockchain interaction through **AI agents**—autonomous programs that act on users’ behalf without ongoing human intervention. These agents plan, execute tasks, and access external tools or data sources in real time.

In today’s fast-evolving AI landscape, you’ve probably encountered terms like LLMs, AI/ML models, or generative AI. **So, how are AI agents different?** Let’s dive in.

## **What Is an AI Agent?**

An AI agent goes beyond traditional models that process data. It’s a system that can:

1. **Access external tools and information**
2. **Reason and plan** to achieve defined goals
3. **Execute tasks** autonomously

For example, imagine a large language model (LLM) capable of querying a customer database to generate personalized shopping recommendations. When this model connects with external data (such as pricing or inventory) and takes self-directed actions (like placing orders), it transforms into an AI agent.

## **Ocada’s AI Agent Use Cases**

Ocada uses AI agents to create **natural-language interfaces** for complex blockchain operations. Ocada develops AI agents capable of analyzing and trading tokens on the Solana blockchain. These agents gather on-chain data - such as transactions and token volumes - and off-chain data from social media (Twitter, Telegram, Discord). The insights they generate are available to users through Ocada’s mobile app on the **App Store**, **Google Play**, and the **Solana dApp Store**.

- **Token Trading & Analysis**: *Users can trade tokens directly within the app, benefiting from AI-driven insights that combine real-time on-chain metrics with off-chain social sentiment.*
- **Portfolio Analysis & Strategy**: Users can ask Ocada’s AI agents to evaluate their portfolios, identify risks, and suggest strategies, making it easier to optimize trading decisions.
- **Trading Feed & Rationale**: A dedicated feed shows what others are trading and their reasons for making those trades. This allows users to learn from different perspectives and market approaches.
- **Copy Trading**: Less experienced traders can follow in the footsteps of successful users - copying their strategies and benefiting from the collective knowledge of top performers.
- **Twitter Portfolio Agent:** Ocada also maintains a publicly visible portfolio on Twitter, managed by an AI agent that factors in both its own analyses and user insights, offering a transparent glimpse into real-time trading decisions.

**Ocada** aims to establish a **marketplace** serving as a central hub for discovering, integrating, and expanding AI agents tailored to blockchain needs - many of which could be built and contributed by the user community.

*"Our goal is to make interacting with blockchains as easy as chatting with a friend,"* says Nikolai Korablin, CTO at Ocada. *"AI agents empower everyone - traders, developers, and casual users - to fully leverage decentralized technology without requiring expertise."*

## **Why Ocada and Nosana Are Teaming Up**

Training and running AI agents demand significant GPU resources. However, the **global GPU shortage** and high cloud-compute costs present barriers to innovation. This is where Nosana excels.

Nosana operates a distributed network of affordable GPUs, delivering compute power at a fraction of traditional cloud provider costs. Through this partnership, Ocada benefits by:

1. **Reducing operational costs** – By shifting workloads to Nosana’s decentralized GPUs.
2. **Scaling efficiently** – Accessing a global GPU pool that grows with user demand.
3. **Enhancing user experience** – Lower costs lead to faster, more accessible AI-driven solutions.

## **How It Works: Nosana’s Static Endpoints**

Nosana’s **static endpoints** make integrating decentralized AI compute seamless. Rather than spinning up new GPU jobs for every AI request, Ocada can use consistent, API-like endpoints to power their services.

- **Consistent Performance** – High-availability endpoints ensure reliable GPU access.
- **Plug-and-Play Integration** – Nosana’s endpoints can be directly incorporated into workflows.
- **Scalability** – Capacity expands on demand without reconfiguring systems.

This allows Ocada to focus on **AI model development**—teaching agents to interpret blockchain data and execute Solana transactions—while Nosana provides the necessary infrastructure.

## **The Future of Blockchain Interaction**

Imagine a ChatGPT-like interface managing your crypto wallet. Soon, you could ask your AI agent to:

- **Analyze market sentiment**
- **Buy tokens with specific liquidity metrics**
- **Audit a smart contract for compliance**
- **Generate and deploy smart contracts on demand**

These capabilities—and many more—are being realized through Ocada’s AI agents. By combining Ocada’s expertise in blockchain intelligence with Nosana’s decentralized GPU network, we’re shaping the future of **decentralized AI** on Solana.

## **Looking ahead**

Ocada is shaping the future of blockchain interactions with AI agents that are smarter, faster, and more intuitive. Partnering with Nosana, they’re driving innovation by making advanced AI technologies more affordable, scalable, and accessible—paving the way for a decentralized, AI-driven tomorrow.
