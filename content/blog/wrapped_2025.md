Systems that had once lived on testnets began running real workloads, and tools designed for demonstrations evolved into components builders could rely on in practice. By the end of the year, Nosana had firmly established itself as part of the real compute stack, supported not by promises or positioning, but by usage, reliability, and work being done on the network.

## **Partnerships & Events**

### In 2025, Nosana’s partnerships and events centered on practical deployments, integrations, and hands-on use of the network.

### [**Folding@Home: Compute for**](https://nosana.com/blog/folding-at-home/) **Scientific Research**

Nosana became one of the **Top 20 monthly contributors worldwide** to Folding@Home \- one of the longest-running and most impactful distributed computing initiatives in existence.

Idle GPU capacity on the Nosana network is now used to accelerate protein simulations, cancer research, Alzheimer’s studies, and other biomedical workloads. This mattered not because it was symbolic, but because it was practical: real compute, running real science, outside centralized infrastructure.

It was a clear signal that decentralized GPU networks can contribute to serious, long-term research, not just short-lived demos.

### **ShipyardNL & Superteam NL: Builders First**

Nosana partnered with ShipyardNL to support Superteam NL and the broader Solana developer ecosystem in the Netherlands. The collaboration focused on direct engagement with builders through hackathons, demo day jury participation, and hands-on support during deployments. For many developers in the region, this marked their first practical experience running inference workloads on decentralized GPUs.

In short: more GPUs, better uptime, fewer compromises.

### [**Rivalz: Infrastructure for Agent Workloads**](https://nosana.com/blog/nosana_parters_with_rivalz/)

Rivalz is building an intelligence layer for autonomous agents. In 2025, their workloads were connected to Nosana’s GPU network.

The result: agents running inference on decentralized hardware rather than centralized cloud providers. This integration reduced costs, removed permission barriers, and aligned both ecosystems around open, composable infrastructure.

### **Piknik: Strengthening Network Resilience**

Nosana also partnered with **Piknik**, a GPU infrastructure provider, to further diversify the network’s compute supply. More providers meant greater decentralization, improved resilience, and a healthier hardware layer overall.

### **Dutch Blockchain Week**

During Dutch Blockchain Week, Nosana engaged directly with developers and ecosystem builders already operating at the intersection of Web3 and compute-intensive applications.

The focus wasn’t evangelism, it was demonstration. Showing that decentralized GPUs can meet real technical expectations in environments where performance actually matters.

### **SuperAI Singapore: Entering Asia’s Compute Market**

SuperAI marked an important step in Nosana’s Asia strategy.

The team connected with founders and developers actively searching for alternatives to centralized compute, at a time when demand for GPU infrastructure across the region is accelerating. The conversations weren’t speculative — they were about costs, reliability, and scaling.

### **WeAreDevelopers World Congress: Compute for Builders**

At Europe’s largest developer conference, Nosana reached students, indie hackers, and early-stage teams who were priced out of traditional cloud infrastructure.

For these builders, decentralized GPUs were a practical choice — a way to access compute and keep building without prohibitive costs.

### **AI DEV Amsterdam: Tooling Meets Infrastructure**

AI DEV brought together teams focused on tooling, workflows, and production pipelines.

Here, Nosana demonstrated how decentralized compute fits into real developer environments, including hybrid architectures and scalable inference without centralized lock-in.

### **BUIDL Day at Token2049 Singapore**

Alongside AI Builders, Nosana co-hosted a BUIDL Day during Token2049.

Founders deployed models live, explored the dashboard, and tested inference on decentralized GPUs. For many, it was the first time decentralized compute felt genuinely usable\!

### **Web3 & AI Hackathon, Leuven**

Nosana supported builders with compute credits, mentoring, and hands-on deployment guidance.

Many participants deployed inference for the first time, taking models from experimentation to live execution.

### **Breakpoint Abu Dhabi: Infrastructure in the Spotlight**

At Solana Breakpoint Abu Dhabi, Nosana joined developers, partners, and founders from across the ecosystem.  
The conversation had shifted from “what is Nosana?” to how far the network has come \- from mainnet stability to real usage, growing demand for decentralized compute, and the launch of the Nosana Grants Program to support the next wave of builders.

## **Product, Network & Ecosystem**

### **Shipping infrastructure that holds up under use**

### **Mainnet Launch (January 14, 2025\)**

On January 14, Nosana launched mainnet.

This marked the end of experimental phases and the beginning of a live, production-ready network. Developers could deploy workloads at scale. GPU hosts began earning on-chain rewards tied to real service delivery.

Mainnet wasn’t a finish line \- it was the starting point.

### [**Nosana Grants Program**](https://nosana.com/blog/grants_announcement/)**: Funding What Actually Moves the Network**

The **Nosana Grants Program** became one of the most important launches of 2025\.

Instead of funding hype, the program supports work that directly improves the ecosystem: deployment tooling, documentation, integrations, templates, and infrastructure improvements. It reflects a shift toward shared ownership of ecosystem development.
