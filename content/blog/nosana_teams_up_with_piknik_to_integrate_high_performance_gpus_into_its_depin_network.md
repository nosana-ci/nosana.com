We're proud to announce an exciting partnership between Nosana and PiKNiK, a leading provider of enterprise-grade infrastructure optimized for the future of the Internet. This collaboration is a major step in our journey to enhance decentralized computing, leveraging PiKNiK's expertise in Web3 and decentralized cloud solutions, particularly their advanced Filecoin operations.

PiKNiK excels in the decentralized cloud space. Known for their advanced Filecoin operations worldwide, they have also been key in training and certification programs for Filecoin storage providers. Now, PiKNiK’s advanced hardware capabilities will be integrated into Nosana’s platform, providing substantial benefits to our users.

A key focus of Nosana’s solutions is tackling the challenge of making GPUs available and accessible to everyone by leveraging a vast network of consumer GPUs through our DePIN-based marketplace. By building a scalable DePIN on the Solana blockchain, we address these challenges head-on. We optimize performance by focusing on small to medium, open large language models (LLMs) that run efficiently on low-memory cards. These strategies enable us to create a highly performant AI inference network at scale.

Thanks to our collaboration with PiKNiK, Nosana now has its first multi-GPU setup available on the network. PiKNiK’s high-performance hardware, including Nvidia A5000 cards and impressive multi-GPU setups like 8x A5000 configurations, will now be accessible through Nosana’s decentralized GPU marketplace. This advancement allows our clients to utilize top-tier computing resources for a variety of applications. PiKNiK’s involvement on the supply side of Nosana’s Test Grid highlights the technical depth and potential of this collaboration, significantly enhancing the capabilities and reach of our platform.
