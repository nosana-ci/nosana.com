## **NOSvember: A Month of Pure Community Energy**

Nosvember wasn’t just an event - it was a celebration of the people who make Nosana feel alive\!  
For a full month, the community joked, created, competed, and filled X and Discord with energy. It wasn’t about prizes, it was about seeing what the Nosana ecosystem becomes when everyone shows up together.

Nosvember reminded us of one thing: **Nosana isn’t just a network. It’s a community with heart.**

## **Powering the KU Leuven Web3 & AI Hackathon**

Nosana proudly powered the Web3 & AI Hackathon at KU Leuven, providing decentralized GPU compute to all participating builders.

We hosted a unique workshop titled **“Breaking Free: AI Agents Without Big Tech”**, giving builders a practical look at how autonomous systems can run without centralized infrastructure.

The day wrapped up with a great networking session where teams connected and exchanged ideas.
